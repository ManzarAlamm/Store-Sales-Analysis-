# Store-Sales-Analysis-
**ðŸ”¹ Python (Google Colab) Project Summary**
I worked on a Sales Forecasting Superstore dataset (2019â€“2020) sourced from Kaggle, primarily focusing on the United States market. The project was divided into two notebooks:

**ðŸ“˜ Notebook 1: Data Cleaning & Preparation**
I used Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy for data cleaning. This included handling null values, data type conversions, removing duplicates, and preparing columns for analysis (e.g., date formatting, region/category segmentation). The code was explained step by step to make it clear and easy to follow.

**ðŸ“Š Notebook 2: Data Visualization & Trend Analysis**
I used Seaborn (with sns.set()) and Matplotlib for insights and trend identification.

**The analysis focused on:
Overall Sales Trend
Profit Trends
Category and Region-wise Analysis
These visualizations helped identify seasonal patterns, regional variations, and underperforming categories.**


**ðŸ”¹ Power BI Dashboard Summary**
Using the same cleaned dataset, I developed a comprehensive Power BI Dashboard to present the analysis in an interactive format:

**ðŸ“Œ Dashboard Design and Layout:**

The dashboard is divided into three pages:
**Overall Sales Overview
Profit Analysis
Category & Region-wise Breakdown**

Each page includes dynamic visuals such as bar charts, line graphs, and slicers that allow users to filter by region, category, or date.  


**âœ… Purpose & Outcome:**

The dashboard was designed to visualize key business metrics, spot important trends, and guide data-driven decisions.
It supports users in exploring sales performance, profit margins, and regional/category-wise behavior over time.
